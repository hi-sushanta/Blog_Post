# Virtual Pen 

***Imagine*** having a magic pen that lets you draw right in the air! This Python code brings that concept to life using your webcam. It turns your hand into a virtual pen, letting you draw on your computer screen without needing a physical pen or tablet. The code cleverly combines two things:

1. Seeing Your Hand: It uses a special computer vision technique to track the movement of your hand, especially your index finger.

2. Making Your Drawings Appear: Based on where your finger moves, the code draws lines on a virtual canvas, like an invisible drawing pad in front of your screen.

## How to using that? ðŸ¤”

1. Get the Code: First, you'll need to download the code for the virtual pen project. You can usually do this by cloning a repository.

2. Find the Virtual Pen Folder: Once you have the code downloaded, navigate to the specific folder within the downloaded files that contains the virtual pen program. This folder might be called "Virtual Pen".

3. Run the Program: Finally, within that folder, locate a file named "main.py". Double-click this file to run the virtual pen program and start drawing!
