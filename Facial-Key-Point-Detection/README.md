# Facial Key Point Detection With DeepLearning

Facial keypoint detection with deep learning is a technique used in computer vision to pinpoint specific locations on a human face in an image or video.
These keypoints act like landmarks, typically corresponding to facial features like eyes, nose, mouth, and sometimes even eyebrows and the outline of the face. 
Deep learning models are particularly adept at this task due to their ability to handle complex patterns.
